# Known issues

Pinned versions, workarounds, and rough edges. Update this file as upstream
fixes land so renovate (which respects `pnpm.overrides`) can be unblocked.

## pnpm.overrides

### `@tanstack/react-router: 1.168.26` + `@tanstack/router-core: 1.169.2`

Two router-core versions coexisting (one pulled by `react-router`, one by
`start-client-core`) prevented `server.handlers` from being type-augmented
on `createFileRoute`. Pinning both to compatible versions resolves it.

**Unblock when**: TanStack publishes a release where `react-router` and
`react-start` agree on a single `router-core` version.

### `@tanstack/react-start: 1.167.65`

Pinned in lockstep with the router pin above.

### `better-call: 1.3.4`

`better-call@1.3.5` ships without `openapi.mjs` and `validator.mjs`,
breaking Better Auth's runtime imports. Pinned to the last working release.

**Unblock when**: a `better-call` release re-includes the missing files
(or Better Auth bumps past the regression).

## Zod v4 required for Better Auth 1.6.10

Better Auth's `better-call` subdependency uses `.meta()` on Zod schemas,
which is **v4-only**. The install warning is the only signal — runtime
errors otherwise look like opaque schema failures.

We ship `zod ^4.4.3`. If you must downgrade, also pin `better-auth` to a
release that supports zod v3.

## Resend test-mode trap

`new Resend(component, { testMode: <bool> })` defaults to `true`. We pass
`testMode: process.env.RESEND_TEST_MODE !== 'false'` so production emails
actually fly. Symptom of the wrong setting: "Test mode is enabled, but
email address is not a valid resend test address".

## macOS Finder duplicates

Any `* 2.ts` / `* 2.tsx` file (created by Finder copy/paste or "Save as"
sidebars) will be picked up by Convex AND Vite and break the build with
ambiguous module errors. After heavy file-move ops, run:

```
find . \( -path ./node_modules -o -path ./.output \) -prune -o \
  -type f \( -name '* 2.ts' -o -name '* 2.tsx' \) -print
```

## Anthropic model id

`convex/agent.ts` defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-5`. Override via the
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` Convex env var to pick a different model. Anthropic
sometimes ships dated aliases (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20251022`) for stability.

## Convex dev typecheck

`pnpm exec convex dev` runs its own typecheck (`--typecheck=enable`). If
that fails the deploy is rejected. Use `pnpm typecheck` separately to keep
the local feedback loop tight; the Convex check catches the same errors at
deploy time anyway.
